# Dashi 
Dashi, is also named foodie, is a web service which aims to use personalization to improve restaurant search and recommendation based on visit history.
Here is the introduction of my project.
Developed an interactive web page (HTML/javascript) for users to search restaurants, update preference and view recommended restaurants.
Developed a web service using (Java servlet, REST API) to fetch restaurant data from Yelp API.
Utilized MySQL to store user preference and restaurant information. 
Improved recommendation precision by designing a content-based recommendation algorithm to match similar restaurants.
Tested the webservice and app with unit tests (JUnit).
